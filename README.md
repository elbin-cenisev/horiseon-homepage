Homework Assignment: Refactoring code for the Horiseon Homepage
Author (of refactoring): Elbin Cenisev

## Description

This assignment involved refactoring existing html and css code for a fictional company's homepage.

## Original Code

The existing html and css code are contained within the "Original" folder.
Any comments in these original files are my own and not of the original author.

## Bug Fixes 

The original code was already functional and my refactoring of the code did not affect any functional or visual aspects of the page.
The only functional problem with the original code was that the "Search Engine Optimization" link did not work due to it linking to a class instead of an id. That is fixed now.

## Optimizations

The original HTML code, while functional, was chaotic and did not use many semantic elements. 
I have restructured the code, added semantic elements and generally divided the code into clear sections to make it more easily readible.
The original CSS code was also somewhat bloated and unorganized. 
My refactoring aimed at conslidating some of the selectors so that the page can load faster and make it easier to read.
